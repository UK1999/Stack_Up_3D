# Stack_Up_3D
Stack Up 3D is a game developed by Umesh Kandekar by using Unity 3D Software. This game was created as my college project and also showcased in a gaming seminar by our professor but due to time restrictions no further levels were created. But overall I learnt a lot at the time of creating this fun and interesting game.
